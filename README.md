# Digit Classification with PCA

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **Logistic Regression** for classification.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Dataset: **Scikit-learn Digits dataset**
- Each digit image is **8Ã—8 pixels (64 features)**
- PCA reduces features from **64 â†’ 30**
- Logistic Regression is trained on PCA-transformed data
- Achieved accuracy: **~96%**
- Also includes **2D PCA visualization** to see digit clusters

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
1. **Features (64 inputs)**:  
   Each image has 64 pixel intensity values (0â€“16).  

2. **PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)**:  
   - Compresses data while keeping maximum information.  
   - Reduces 64-dimensional space into 30 components for training.  
   - For visualization, reduced into 2D.  

3. **Logistic Regression (Classification)**:  
   Predicts which digit (0â€“9) an image belongs to.

## âœ… Conclusion
PCA helps reduce feature dimensions, speeds up training, removes noise, and enables visualization.  
This makes it a powerful preprocessing step for ML pipelines.
